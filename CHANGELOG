* better src file organization (adapters/core/rendering folders)

*2.7.3

* initializing SimpleNavigation.config_file_path with empty array (was nil before). Allows for adding paths before gem has been initialized.

* use request.fullpath instead of request.request_uri for Rails3. Credits to Ben Langfeld.

*2.4.2

* Rails 3.0.0.beta2 compatibility
* Renderer::List --> make content of ul-tag html_safe for rails 3.0.0.beta2 (due to rails3 XSS protection). Credits to Johan Svensson and Disha Albaqui.
* updated copyright
* reduced visibility of 'sn_set_navigation' to protected

*2.4.1

* removing depencency to rails. It installs the newest rails, even if a matching version is present. why is that?

*2.4.0

* added Rails3 compatibility
* added Jeweler::Gemcutter Tasks to Rakefile

*2.2.3

* changed error handling in config-file. Do not ignore errors in config-file anymore.
* only load config-file if it is present. Needed when directly providing items in render_navigation.

*2.2.2

* added lib/simple-navigation.rb to allow 'require simple-navigation' or 'config.gem "simple-navigation"'

*2.2.1

* Corrected URL to API-Doc on rubyforge in README

* items can now even be passed directly into render_navigation method.

*2.0.1

* fixed handling of a non-existent explicit navigation item for a navigation context

*2.0.0

* added auto_highlight feature. Active navigation is determined by comparing urls, no need to explicitly set it in the controllers anymore. Thanks to Jack Dempsey and Florian Hanke for the support on this.
* added ability to create multi-level navigations (not just limited to primary and secondary navigation). Thanks again to Jack Dempsey for the motivation ;-)
* simplified the process to explicitly set the navigation in the controller (where needed) - only deepest level has to be specified

* ability to turn off automatic generation of dom_ids for the list items (autogenerate_item_ids). Credits again to Richard Hulse.
* ability to specify dom_class for primary and secondary lists. Thanks Richard!

*1.2.2

* renderers now have access to request_forgery_protection stuff (this allows delete-links as navigation-items)

*1.2.1

* changed way to include render_*-helper_methods into view (including them into Controller and declaring them as helper_methods instead of adding whole module as Helper). this seems to be more reliable under certain conditions. Credits to Gernot Kogler.

*1.2.0

* added capability to add conditions to navigation-items (primary.item key, name, url, :if => Proc.new {current_user.admin?})

*1.1.2

* Bugfix: config now gets evaluated on every render_navigation call. Credits to Joël Azémar.
* Config file gets reloaded on every render_navigation call in development mode. Only load config file on server start in production mode.
