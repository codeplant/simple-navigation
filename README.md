To run the test suite locally against all supported frameworks:

    % bundle install
    % rake spec:all

To target the test suite against one framework:

    % rake spec:rails-4-2-stable

You can find a list of supported spec tasks by running rake -T. You may also find it useful to run a specific test for a specific framework. To do so, you'll have to first make sure you have bundled everything for that configuration, then you can run the specific test:

% BUNDLE_GEMFILE='gemfiles/rails-4-2-stable.gemfile' bundle install -j 4
% BUNDLE_GEMFILE='gemfiles/rails-4-2-stable.gemfile' bundle exec rspec ./spec/requests/users_spec.rb

### Rake and Bundler

If you use a shell plugin (like oh-my-zsh:bundler) that auto-prefixes commands with `bundle exec` using the `rake` command will fail.

Get the original command with `type -a rake`:

    % type -a rake
    rake is an alias for bundled_rake
    rake is /Users/username/.rubies/ruby-2.2.3/bin/rake
    rake is /usr/bin/rake

In this situation `/Users/username/.rubies/ruby-2.2.3/bin/rake` is the command you should use.
